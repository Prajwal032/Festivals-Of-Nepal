                <div class="festival">
                    <div class="text-container">Holi (Hindi pronunciation: ['hoːli:]) is a popular and significant Hindu
                        festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love, and Spring. It celebrates the eternal
                        and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna. Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of
                        good over evil, as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha over
                        Hiranyakashipu. Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent, but
                        has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian
                        diaspora.

                        Holi also celebrates the arrival of spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of
                        love. It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season. It lasts for a night
                        and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (full moon day) falling on the Hindu calendar
                        month of
                        Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar.
                        Holi is a sacred ancient tradition of Hindus, a holiday in many states of India with regional
                        holidays
                        in other countries. It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an
                        opportunity
                        to have fun banter with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other. It is
                        also
                        observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the
                        last full
                        moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month, marking the spring, making the date vary with
                        the lunar
                        cycle. The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian
                        calendar. </div>

                        India. It is celebratedespecially in the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Eastern Uttar
                        Pradesh;and the Nepalese Autonomous provinces of Koshi, Lumbini, and Madhesh.In the
                        major northern urban centres, hundreds of thousands of Nepalis and East Indians celebrate it in
                        cities
                        including Kathmandu Valley, Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta. During Chhath Puja, prayers are
                        dedicated to the solar deity, Surya: to show gratitude for bestowing the bounties of life on
                        Earth and
                        to request that certain wishes be granted.

                        Chhathi Maiya, the sixth form of Prakriti and Surya's sister, is worshipped during the festival.
                        It is
                        celebrated six days after Deepavali, or Tihar, on the sixth day of the lunar month of Kartika

                        or November) in the Hindu calendar (Vikram Samvat), and hence why it is called Surya Shashti
                        Vrata. The rituals are observed over three nights and four days. They include holy
                        bathing, fasting, and abstaining from drinking water (as a vrata), standing in water, and
                        offering
                        prasada (prayer offerings) and arghya to the rising and setting of the Sun. Some devotees also
                        perform a prostration march as they head towards the riverbanks. All devotees prepare similar
                        prasada (religious food) and offerings.
